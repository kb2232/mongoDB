mongod --directoryperdb --dbpath ../data/db --logpath ../log/mongo.log --logappend --rest --install

export PATH=<mongodb-install-directory>/bin:$PATH

-->mongo (remember mongo database is a NoSQL)
1. start the mongod
>>sudo mongod
2. on a different terminal window enter - below is where i kept my installed file
>>export PATH=/Users/kb2232/Desktop/udemy/mongodb/mongodb-osx-x86_64-3.0.15/bin:$PATH
>>mongo


###PROMISE
A promise is a tool used to manage asynchronous code.
If a code needs to be executed in the future, like after a certain time - then we use promise;
Promise can be:
1. unresolved - waiting for the user / piece of code to finish - a function that calls your code
2. resolved - everything went well - this is handled with .then(()=>{...})
3. rejected - if a piece of code fails - this is handled with .catch(()=>{...})

Most libraries: Jquery, Axios, Mongoose do not require you to create a new promise.
Most developers just handle the success or failure of the promises.

####The way mongo works is via instances:
Say today you work on collection of books and collection of Users:
Each of these collections are one instance created in mongo itself.

                1. Mongo - database#1
                  2. collection of books
                    2a. book1
                    2b. book2
                    2c. book3
                  3. collection of Users
                    3a. user1
                    3b. user2

                1. Mongo - database#2
                  2. collection of movies
                  3. collection of images

A single mongo database can have multiple internal databases;
Inside each internal database can have multiple collections. Where one collection is a type of data, like collection of users or collection of stories.

                    CORE idea in Mongoose is below:
########CRUD ----create --- read --- update --- delete;
